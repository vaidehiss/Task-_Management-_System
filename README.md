# Task Management System

This repository contains a simple task management system implemented using Python and PyQt5. The task management system provides a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) for managing tasks, including adding new tasks, viewing existing tasks, and marking tasks as completed.

## Features

- Add New Task: Easily add new tasks to the system using a dialog window.
- View Tasks: View the list of tasks in a separate dialog window.
- Complete Task: Mark tasks as completed from a dialog window.
- Exit Confirmation: When attempting to exit the application, a confirmation dialog prompts the user for confirmation.

## Getting Started

To run the task management system locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/usman010803/Task_Management_System.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd Task_Management_System
```

3. Install the required dependencies. Ensure that you have Python and PyQt5 installed.

```bash
pip install pyqt5
```

4. Run the application:

```bash
python task_management_system.py
```

## Usage

Upon launching the application, a main window will appear, providing access to various functionalities:

- Click the "Add New Task" button to add a new task.
- Click the "View Tasks" button to view the list of tasks.
- Click the "Complete Task" button to mark a task as completed.
- Click the "Exit" button to close the application.

Please note that the task management system currently does not persist tasks beyond the current runtime. Tasks will be lost once the application is closed.
